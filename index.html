                <p class="text-small">Online learning is education that takes place over the Internet.
                    It is often referred to as “e- learning” among other terms. However, online learning
                    is just one type of “distance learning” - the umbrella term for any learning that takes
                    place across distance and not in a traditional classroom.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary
                education. In 2011, Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.
                India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic
                development. Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been
                credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over
                the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013, there still remains a significant
                distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that
                will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's
                comparatively young population.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of
                higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded
                a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of
                particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential
                quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest
                university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were
                taught in Ariano -páli Language.


                Sammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging
                fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became
                centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught.
                Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related
                to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the Sammanas, were imparted
                knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the Kshatriya,
                were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the Vaishya, were taught their trade
                and the working class of the Shudras was generally deprived of educational advantages.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Learn TogetherFrom the first Five-year Plan onwards, India's emphasis
                was to develop a pool of scientifically inclined manpower. India's National Policy on Education (NPE)
                provisioned for an apex body for regulation and development of higher technical education, which came
                into being as the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in 1987 through an act of the Indian
                parliament.[90] At the federal level, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institute of Space
                Science and Technology, the National Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Information
                Technology are deemed of national importance.

                The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are among the
                nation's premier education facilities.


                Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee
                The UGC has inter-university centres at a number of locations throughout India to promote common
                research, e.g. the Nuclear Science Centre at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Besides there
                are some British established colleges such as Harcourt Butler Technological Institute situated in Kanpur
                and King George Medical University situated in Lucknow which are important centre of higher education.
